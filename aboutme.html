        <p>Hello, I'm Chuck. My journey of education began in a refugee camp in Uganda and took a significant turn when I moved to America in 2016. That's where I discovered my fascination with technology, which has since shaped my path.</p>
        <p>Soccer has always been a big part of my life, from playing as a kicker at Concordia University to enjoying pick-up games with friends. Outside of soccer, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology and love to relax by cooking and having BBQs with friends.</p>
